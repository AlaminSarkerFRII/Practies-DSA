## What are Python Arrays?
```
Python Arrays are a data structure that can hold a collection of items. Unlike lists, which can hold items of different data types, arrays in Python are typically used to store items of the same data type. This makes them more efficient for numerical computations. Python does not have a built-in array data type, but the ‘array’ module provides an array type that can be used for this purpose.

## What is the difference between Lists and Arrays in Python?
```
The main difference between lists and arrays in Python is that lists can hold items of different data types, while arrays are designed to hold items of the same data type. Arrays are more memory efficient and provide better performance for numerical operations. However, lists are more flexible and easier to use for general-purpose programming.

## Can you resize a Python Array?
```
Python arrays do not support dynamic resizing like lists do. However, you can create a new array with a different size and copy the elements from the old array to the new one. Alternatively, you can use the ‘array’ module’s ‘extend’ method to add more elements to the existing array, but this does not change the size of the array itself.

## Find Elements from the array or list in python ( Main Concept ).


```
Accessing Elements in the List:

lists[i]
lists[i] accesses the element at index i in the list.
When i = 0, lists[i] gives 'a'.
When i = 1, lists[i] gives 'b'.
... and so on.

-------------------

The if Condition:

if lists[i] == 'a':
This checks if the element at index i is equal to 'a'.
Example:
When i = 0, lists[0] is 'a', so lists[i] == 'a' is True.
When i = 1, lists[1] is 'b', so lists[i] == 'a' is False.
