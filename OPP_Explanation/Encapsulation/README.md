`****Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that bundles data and methods into a single unit.
 It's a way to organize and protect data by hiding implementation details..****`

### I Used Django for Describing Encapsulation

```
How Encapsulation works :

1.Data Hiding : 
    - Encapsulation helps to hide the data from the outside world.we can achieve this by using access modifiers , like private, protected, and public.
    - In Django, we can hide the data by using the private variables.
    - We can use the double underscore (__) before the variable name to make it private.
    - We can access the private variable by using the getter and setter methods.
    
2.Controller Access :
    instead of accessing the data directly, we can use the controller to access the data.
    encapsulation provides getter and setter methods to read and modify the data.

3.Building Data and Method: Encapsulation groups related data and method into a single unit(class), 
    making the code more organized and easier to maintain
