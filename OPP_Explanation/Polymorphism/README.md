### Polymorphism 

```
 The word itself indicates the meaning as poly means many and morphism means types.

 The most common use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.


 In a real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different roles to play in life. Like a woman, at the same time is a mother, a wife, an employee and a daughter. So the same person has to have many features but has to implement each as per the situation and the condition. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.

#### Method Overriding

#### Method Overloading
>In Python, overloading usually refers to the ability to define a method in multiple ways so that it can be called with different numbers of parameters or types. Python doesn’t support method overloading in the same way as languages like Java or C++, where you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. However, Python does allow operator overloading, which means you can change the meaning of an operator depending on the operands used.
